  "heroLead": "At the heart of the festival is the open practice hall, where everyone can juggle freely, share new patterns, and explore passing games together. Guided workshops add focused learning with expert jugglers, while community showcases, friendly competitions, and an open-stage renegade night invite anyone to perform. Over three bright days by the Aegean coast, we gather for an inclusive, FLINTA+ friendly celebration of skill-sharing, playful experimentation, and joyful connection.",
