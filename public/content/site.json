Guided workshops add focused learning with expert jugglers, while community showcases, friendly competitions, and an open-stage renegade night invite anyone to perform. Over three bright days by the Aegean coast, we gather for an inclusive, FLINTA+ friendly celebration of skill-sharing, playful experimentation, and joyful connection.",
